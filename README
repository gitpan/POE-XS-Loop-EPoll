POE::XS::Loop::EPoll is an implementation of the abstract POE::Loop
interface written in C using the Linux epoll family of system calls.

So your system will need to have the epoll(2) system calls available,
and appropriate headers.

To install:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install  # you may need to be root for this step

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the same terms as Perl itself.
